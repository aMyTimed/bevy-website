Bevy programs store and execute all of their game logic and data with a single {{rust_type(type="struct" crate="bevy" mod = "app" name="App" no_mod = "true")}} data structure.

Let's make a trivial Hello World app to demonstrate how that works in practice.
The process is straightforward: we first create a new {{rust_type(type="struct" crate="bevy" mod = "app" name="App" no_mod = "true")}}.
Then, we add a simple system, which prints "Hello, Bevy!" when it is run.
Finally once we're done configuring the app, we call {{rust_type(type="struct" crate="bevy" mod = "app" name="App" no_mod = "true")}} to actually make our app *do things*.

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main(){
    App::new()
        .add_system(hello)
        .run();
}

fn hello(){
    println!("Hello, Bevy!")
}
```

## What makes an App?

So, what sort of data does our  {{rust_type(type="struct" crate="bevy" mod = "app" name="App" no_mod = "true")}} really store?
Looking at the docs linked, we find three fields: `world`, `schedule` and `runner`.
The `world` field stores all of our game's data, the `schedule` holds the systems that operate on this data (and the order in which they do so) and the `runner` interprets the schedule to control the broad execution strategy.
You can read more about these by exploring the reference documentation linked just above.

Generally, you'll be operating at a more granular level than these basic primitives: controlling data in terms of specific resources or components and adding systems to an existing schedule.
To do so, customize your own  {{rust_type(type="struct" crate="bevy" mod = "app" name="App" no_mod = "true")}} by chaining its methods with the [builder pattern](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/ownership/builders.html).
The most basic tools are:

  1. Initializing resources in the {{rust_type(type="struct" crate="bevy" mod = "ecs/world" name="World" no_mod = "true")}} to store global data.
  2. Adding systems to our {{rust_type(type="struct" crate="bevy" mod = "ecs/schedule" name="Schedule" no_mod = "true")}} to perform logic.
  3. Importing other blocks of {{rust_type(type="struct" crate="bevy" mod = "app" name="App" no_mod = "true")}}-modifying code using plugins.
Let's write a very simple demo that shows how those work.

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    App::new()
        // Plugins are App code that was written elsewhere,
        // imported as a single unit for organization and clarity
        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
        // Resources are global singleton data stored in the `World`
        .insert_resource(Fibonacci { a: 1, b: 1 })
        // Systems run every pass of the game loop and perform logic
        .add_system(fibonacci_sum.system())
        .add_system(report_fibonacci.system())
        .run();
}

// A simple data structure to store the two current fibonacci numbers
struct Fibonacci {
    a: u64,
    b: u64,
}

// This system requires mutable access to our Fibonacci resource,
// so we add `ResMut` to its function parameters
fn fibonacci_sum(mut fibonacci: ResMut<Fibonacci>) {
    // This crashes fairly quickly, as we overflow our u64 data storage
    let new_sum = fibonacci.a + fibonacci.b;
    fibonacci.a = fibonacci.b;
    fibonacci.b = new_sum;
}

// This system only reads the value of our Fibonacci resource,
// so we only need `Res`
fn report_fibonacci(fibonacci: Res<Fibonacci>) {
    info!(fibonacci.a, fibonacci.b);
}
```
