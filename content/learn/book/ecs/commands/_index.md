**Commands** are powerful, unrestricted tools for modifying the {{rust_type(type="struct" crate="bevy_ecs" name="World")}} of your Bevy game.
Queue them up, and you can reshape the world in arbitrary ways when they're evaluated!

Commands are fundamentally designed to perform work that cannot be safely done in parallel, and are used to change the world in ways that touch large amounts of data at once (requiring exclusive access to the archetypes and other metadata of the {{rust_type(type="struct" crate="bevy_ecs" name="World")}}).
While you can check out the full list of options by reading the API docs for {{rust_type(type="struct" crate="bevy" mod = "ecs/system" name="Commands" no_mod = "true")}} and {{rust_type(type="struct" crate="bevy" mod = "ecs/system" name="EntityCommands" no_mod = "true")}}, commands are commonly used to:

- Spawn and despawn entities with `spawn`, `spawn_bundle` and `commands.entity(my_entity).despawn`
- Add and remove resources dynamically with `init_resource`, `insert_resouce` and `remove_resource`
- Add and remove components to entities with `commands.entity(my_entity).insert` and `commands.entity(my_entity).remove`

Due to the limitations on the parallel execution of the operations performed using commands, **commands do not take effect immediately.**
This is, by and large, their defining characteristic: they must wait until the next **hard sync point** (where single function have access to the entire world in a sequential fashion) in order to be resolved as they require exclusive mutable access to the world.
Unless you are already operating in an exclusive way on the {{rust_type(type="struct" crate="bevy_ecs" name="World")}}, commands are typically going to be processed at the end of the current stage.

As a result, **avoid using commands unnecessarily**.
For example, you *could* use the overwriting behavior of component insertion to mutate components in place.
However, this is unclear, slow and takes delayed effect, making it strictly worse than just requesting the appropriate data and mutating it in an ordinary fashion.

## Using Commands

As discussed in [entities have components](../entities-components/_index.md), commands are used by adding a {{rust_type(type="struct" crate="bevy" mod = "ecs/system" name="Commands" no_mod = "true")}}-type argument to your function, than calling various methods to it.
For a basic overview of how they're used, please refer to that page.
For more detailed information on the available methods, check {{rust_type(type="struct" crate="bevy" mod = "ecs/system" name="Commands" no_mod = "true")}} and {{rust_type(type="struct" crate="bevy" mod = "ecs/system" name="EntityCommands" no_mod = "true")}}.

### Custom commands

You can extend the {{rust_type(type="trait" crate="bevy" mod = "ecs/system" name="Command" no_mod = "true")}} trait to create your own commands, performing tasks with far-reaching consequences without requiring access to that data in your originating systems.

Let's walk through the steps needed to create a new custom command:

```rust
// First, we need to create a struct that stores any data needed by the command
struct CountEntities {
    // This functionality is not very useful,
    // and is included for teaching purposes
    message: String,
}

// Next, we need to implement the `Command` trait for that struct
// which describes how the command changes the world
impl Command for CountEntities {
    fn write(self, world: &mut World) {
        info!(
            "The world has {} entities in it. BTW, \"{}\"!",
            world.entities().len(),
            self.message.to_string(),
        );
    }
}
// Then, we create an extension trait, which allows us to add new methods to commands
trait EntityCounting {
    fn count_entities(&mut self, message: String);
}

// Finally, we implement that trait for the `Commands` type,
// adding our new command type to the command queue
impl<'a> EntityCounting for Commands<'a> {
    // We can now call `commands.count_entities(message)`
    // on any instance of `Commands` when we have
    // the `EntityCounting` trait in scope
    fn count_entities(&mut self, message: String) {
        self.add(CountEntities { String })
    }
}
```

Due to the delayed effect of commands, and their relatively poor performance (they can only be executed one at a time in sequence), you should only use custom commands for tasks that truly need their world-altering powers.
In many cases, an event plus an event-handling system will be faster, more ergonomic and easier to debug.

For more details on how to perform logic in custom commands, see the page on [exclusive world access](../exclusive-world-access/_index.md).

### Manually flushing commands

Ordinarily, commands are only applied at the end of each stage.
This is because they require exclusive mutable access to the {{rust_type(type="struct" crate="bevy_ecs" name="World")}}.

However, if you already have exclusive access to the {{rust_type(type="struct" crate="bevy_ecs" name="World")}}, you can use [`SystemState::<Commands>::apply()`](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/ecs/system/struct.SystemState#method.apply) to immediately run and clear any {{rust_type(type="struct" crate="bevy" mod = "ecs/system" name="Commands" no_mod = "true")}} that may have accumulated.

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;
use bevy::ecs::system::SystemState;

let world = World::new();

let mut system_state = SystemState::<Commands>::new(&mut world);

// Manually adding a command to the list to verify that this works
let mut commands = system_state.get_mut();
commands.spawn();

// Applies all accumulated commands to the world, causing them to take immediate effect
system_state.apply(&mut world);
```

Generally speaking, this isn't useful for the average game: you can't get exclusive world access any faster than commands naturally apply.
However, this technique can be incredibly useful for advanced control flows that are willing to sacrifice some parallelism in order to immediately (or repeatedly) process commands.

## Mechanisms of commands

Due to their special nature, the internal mechanics of commands are not entirely clear upon inspection.
This section discusses a few of the details that can matter as an advanced end user.

### System parallelism and commands

Interestingly, more than one system can add {{rust_type(type="struct" crate="bevy" mod = "ecs/system" name="Commands" no_mod = "true")}} at once.
This is safe to do so due to the append-only nature of the data structure.
A fresh {{rust_type(type="struct" crate="bevy" mod = "ecs/system" name="Commands" no_mod = "true")}} struct is dispatched to each system and then each instance processed later according to the execution order of the originating systems.
This is quite useful as it increases system parallelism in important ways ({{rust_type(type="struct" crate="bevy" mod = "ecs/system" name="Commands" no_mod = "true")}} are quite common), but it standards in stark contrast to Bevy's resources, which use [standard "no aliased mutability" logic](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/borrow/alias.html).

### Application order

When combining the effects of multiple commands, it can be important to be aware of the exact order in which your commands are executed can be vitally important.
If one system is spawning an entity and then passing off its {{rust_type(type="trait" crate="bevy_ecs" mod = "entity" name="Entity" no_mod = "true")}}` identifier to another system, that needs to occur before the second system attempts to add components to it!

Thankfully, while their effect is delayed, their application order follows a few simple rules:

1. Commands are always applied one at a time.
2. All commands created by a given system are applied sequentially, in the order in which the methods were called on the {{rust_type(type="struct" crate="bevy" mod = "ecs/system" name="Commands" no_mod = "true")}} object in that system.
3. If a system is explicitly specified (using `.before` or `.after`) to occur before another system, its commands will always be applied first.
4. If two systems do not have an explicit ordering between them (including any transitive ordering from e.g. A before B before C), the order in which their commands are applied is unspecified, and may vary between runs of the app.

For more information on how to control system ordering, please read the [System Ordering](../../game-logic/system-ordering/_index.md) page in the next chapter.
