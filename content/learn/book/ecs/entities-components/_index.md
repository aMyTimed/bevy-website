As we discussed in the introduction to this chapter, **entities** represent objects in your game world, whose data is stored in the form of components.

## Spawning and despawning entities

Before you can do much of anything in Bevy, you'll need to **spawn** your first entity, adding it to the app's [`World`].
Once entities exist, they can likewise be despawned, deleting all of the data stored in their components and removing it from the world.

There are two APIs to do so. The first is more direct, allowing you to add and remove entities directly on the world.

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

// Creates a new world
let mut world = World::new();
// Spawns an entity with no components
world.spawn();
// Spawns a second entity, keeping track of its unique identifier
let my_entity = world.spawn().id();
// Uses the second entity's unique identifier to despawn it
world.despawn(my_entity);
```

If you're using Bevy as a whole (rather than just [`bevy_ecs`]), you'll tend to find that working with the world directly is rare:
often reserved for [writing tests](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/tests/how_to_test_systems.rs).
Instead, almost all of your logic will be contained within systems,
which don't have the permissions to immediately spawn or despawn new entities (what if someone else was using that?!).
To work around this, we use **commands**, which have a delayed effect.
For now, let's take a look at how we can use them to work with entities in simple ways (you can read about all the details [later in this chapter](../commands/_index.md)).

```rust
// This system needs to have a mutable argument with the `Commands` type
// allowing it to queue up commands to be processed at the end of the stage
fn spawning_system(mut commands: Commands){
    // These commands perform the exact same operations
    // as the previous code snippet,
    // but at the end of the stage, rather than immediately
    commands.spawn();
    let my_entity = commands.spawn().id();
    commands.despawn(my_entity);
}
```

## Working with components

Entities are entirely bare when they're spawned: they contain no data other than their unique [`Entity`] identifier.
This of course is not very useful, so let's discuss how we can add and remove components to them which store data and enable behavior through systems.

[`Entity`]: https://docs.rs/bevy/0.6.0/bevy/ecs/entity/struct.Entity.html

### Defining components

To define a component type, we simply implement the [`Component`] trait to a Rust type of our choice.
You will almost always want to use the `#[derive(Component)]` macro to do this for you; which quickly and reliably generates the correct trait code for the trait.
Any underlying component data must be `Send + Sync + 'static` (enforced by the [trait bounds](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html#trait-bound-syntax) on [`Component`]).
This ensures that the data can be sent across the threads safely and allows our [type reflection tools](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/main/crates/bevy_reflect) to work correctly.

With the theory out of the way, let's define some components!

```rust
// This is a dataless "unit struct", which holds no data of its own.
// In Bevy, these are useful for distinguishing similar entities or toggling behavior
// and are called "marker components"
#[derive(Component)]
struct Combatant;

// These simple components wrap a u8 in a tuple struct
#[derive(Component)]
struct Life(u8);
#[derive(Component)]
struct Attack(u8);
#[derive(Component)]
struct Defense(u8);

// Here, we use a tuple struct to store 2 ordered pieces of data
#[derive(Component)]
struct Position(i32, i32);

// Naming your components' fields,
// makes them easier and safer to refer to
#[derive(Component)]
struct Stats {
    strength: u8,
    dexterity: u8,
    intelligence: u8,
}

// Enum components are great for storing mutually exclusive states
#[derive(Component)]
enum Allegiance {
    Friendly,
    Neutral,
    Hostile
}

// We can store arbitrary data in our components, as long as it has a 'static lifetime
// Types without lifetimes are always 'static,
// allowing us to safely hold a String, but not a &str
#[derive(Component)]
struct Name(String);
```

[`Component`]: https://docs.rs/bevy/0.6.0/bevy/ecs/component/trait.Component.html

### Spawning entities with components

Now that we have some components defined, let's try adding them to our entities using [`Commands`].

```rust
fn spawn_combatants_system(mut commands: Commands) {
    commands
        .spawn()
        // This inserts a data-less `Combatant` component into the entity we're spawning
        .insert(Combatant)
        // We configure starting component values by passing in concrete instances of our types
        .insert(Life(10))
        // By chaining .insert method calls like this, we continue to add more components to our entity
        .insert(Attack(5))
        .insert(Defense(2))
        .insert(Position(0, 0))
        // Instances of named structs are constructed with {field_name: value}
        .insert(Stats {
            strength: 15,
            dexterity: 10,
            intelligence: 8,
        })
        // Instances of enums are created by picking one of their variants
        .insert(Allegiance::Friendly)
        .insert(Name("Gallant".to_string()));

    // We've ended our Commands method chain using a ;,
    // and so now we can create a second entity
    // by calling .spawn() again
    commands
        .spawn()
        .insert(Combatant)
        .insert(Life(10))
        .insert(Attack(5))
        .insert(Defense(1))
        .insert(Position(0, 5))
        .insert(Stats {
            strength: 17,
            dexterity: 8,
            intelligence: 6,
        })
        .insert(Allegiance::Hostile)
        .insert(Name("Goofus".to_string()));
}
```

[`Commands`]: https://docs.rs/bevy/0.6.0/bevy/ecs/system/struct.Commands.html

### Adding and removing components

Once an entity is spawned, you can use [`Commands`] to add and remove components from them dynamically.

```rust

#[derive(Component)]
struct InCombat;

// This query returns the `Entity` identifier of all entities
// that have the `Combatant` component but do not yet have the `InCombat` component
fn start_combat_system(query: Query<Entity, (With<Combatant>, Without<InCombat>>, mut commands: Commands){
    for entity in query.iter(){
        // The component will be inserted at the end of the current stage
        commands.entity(entity).insert(InCombat);
    }
}

// Now to undo our hard work
fn end_combat_system(query: Query<Entity, (With<Combatant>, With<InCombat>>, mut commands: Commands){
    for entity in query.iter(){
        // The component will be removed at the end of the current stage
        commands.entity(entity).remove(InCombat);
    }
}
```

## Bundles

As you might guess, the one-at-a-time component insertion syntax can be both tedious and error-prone as your project grows.
To get around this, Bevy abstracts these patterns using **bundles**: named and typed collections of components.
These are implemented by adding the [`Bundle`] trait to a struct; turning each of its fields into a distinct component on your entity when they are inserted.

Let's try rewriting that code from above.

`Life`, `Attack` and `Defense` will almost always be added to our entities at the same time, so let's create a **bundle** (collection of components) to make them easier to work with.

```rust
#[derive(Bundle)]
struct CombatantBundle {
    combatant: Combatant
    life: Life,
    attack: Attack,
    defense: Defense,
    position: Position,
    stats: Stats,
    allegiance: Allegiance,
}

// We can add new methods to our bundle type that return Self
// to create principled APIs for entity creation.
// The Default trait is the standard tool for creating
// new struct instances without configuration 
impl Default for CombatantBundle {
    fn default() -> Self {
        CombatantBundle {
            combatant: Combatant,
            life: Life(10),
            attack: Attack(5),
            defense: Defense(1),
            position: Position(0, 0),
            stats: Stats {
                strength: 10,
                dexterity: 10,
                intelligence: 10,
            }
            allegiance: Allegiance::Neutral,
        }
    }
}

fn spawn_combatants_system(mut commands: Commands) {
    commands
        .spawn()
        // We're using struct-update syntax to modify 
        // the instance of `CombatantBundle` returned by its default() method
        // See the page on Rust Tips and Tricks at the end of this chapter for more info!
        .insert_bundle(CombatantBundle{
            defense: Defense(2),
            stats: Stats {
                strength: 15,
                dexterity: 10,
                intelligence: 8,
            }
            allegiance: Allegiance::Friendly,
            ..Default::default()
        })
        // We can continue to chain more .insert or .insert_bundle methods
        // to add more components and extend behavior
        .insert(Name("Gallant".to_string()));
    
    commands
        // .spawn_bundle is just syntactic sugar for .spawn().insert_bundle
        .spawn_bundle(CombatantBundle{
            stats: Stats {
                strength: 17,
                dexterity: 8,
                intelligence: 6,
            }
            position: Position(0, 5),
            allegiance: Allegiance::Hostile,
            ..Default::default()
        })
        .insert(Name("Goofus".to_string()));}
```

### Nested bundles

As your game grows further in complexity, you may find that you want to reuse various bundles across entities that share some but not all behavior.
One of the tools you can use to do so is **nested bundles**; embedding one bundle of components within another.
Be mindful; this can lead to overwrought, deeply nested code if overused and bundles are [not currently checked](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2387) for duplicate component types.
Later instances of the same type will overwrite earlier ones.

With those caveats out of the way, let's take a look at the syntax by converting the bundle above to a nested one by creating a bundle of components that deal with related functionality.

```rust
#[derive(Bundle)]
struct AttackableBundle{
    life: Life,
    attack: Attack,
    defense: Defense,
}

#[derive(Bundle)]
struct CombatantBundle {
    combatant: Combatant
    // This attribute macro marks our attackable_bundle field as a bundle,
    // allowing Bevy to properly flatten it out when building the final entity
    #[bundle]
    attackable_bundle: AttackableBundle,
    position: Position,
    stats: Stats,
    allegiance: Allegiance,
}

impl Default for CombatantBundle {
    fn default() -> Self {
        CombatantBundle {
            combatant: Combatant,
            attackable_bundle: AttackableBundle {
                life: Life(10),
                attack: Attack(5),
                defense: Defense(1),
            }
            position: Position(0, 0),
            stats: Stats {
                strength: 10,
                dexterity: 10,
                intelligence: 10,
            }
            allegiance: Allegiance::Neutral,
        }
    }
}
```
