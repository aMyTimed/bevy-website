Thanks to **X** contributors, **X** pull requests, community reviewers, and our [**generous sponsors**](/community/donate), I'm happy to announce the **Bevy 0.10** release on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bevy)!

For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out our [Quick Start Guide](/learn/book/getting-started/) to try it today. It's free and open source forever! You can grab the full [source code](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) on GitHub. Check out [Bevy Assets](https://bevyengine.org/assets) for a collection of community-developed plugins, games, and learning resources.

To update an existing Bevy App or Plugin to **Bevy 0.10**, check out our [0.9 to 0.10 Migration Guide](/learn/book/migration-guides/0.9-0.10/).

Since our last release a few months ago we've added a _ton_ of new features, bug fixes, and quality of life tweaks, but here are some of the highlights:

<!-- more -->

* **Simpler, more flexible scheduling**: systems are now stored in a unified schedule, commands can be applied explicitly via `apply_system_buffers` and a whole lot of quality of life and bug fixes.

## Simpler, more flexible scheduling

<div class="release-feature-authors">authors: @alice-i-cecile, @maniwani, @WrongShoe and a whole lot more </div>

Description here.

## What's Next?

* **One-shot systems**: Run arbitrary systems in a push-based fashion via commands, and store them as callback components for ultra-flexible behavior customization.
